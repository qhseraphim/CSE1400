# this is how to run and debug your assembly



# going to the folder where you are working on an assembly file
cd /mnt/e/Computer\ Science\ \&\ Engineering/CSE1400

# opening the visual studio code environment for such a folder
code .

    # assembling your code with no debug flags, to destination, from source
    gcc -no-pie -o nameofyourprogram nameofyoursource.s

    # running the assembled program
    ./nameofyourprogram

        # example of regular usage
        gcc -no-pie -o t1 recursion.s
        ./t1

    # assemble your code with flags such that you can debug, to destination, from source
    gcc -no-pie -g -o nameofyourprogram nameofyoursource.s

    # debugging run of your assembled program
    gdb ./nameofyourprogram
